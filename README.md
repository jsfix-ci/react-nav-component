# React-Nav-Component

This component does not work on it's own. See my [portfolio](https://alexandermorton.co.uk) of an example of it running.

It depends on share and account component which needs to be installed. The different branches are for different projects. 

# Build

```
git clone https://github.com/mortonprod/react-account-component account
git clone https://github.com/mortonprod/react-share-component share
```

The import navigation to your app. You will need to have your favorite bundler deal with babel and imported css from the navigation.
